    Descriptive and Meaningful Names: Use names that clearly describe the purpose.
    Consistency: Use consistent naming conventions.
    Avoid Abbreviations: Use clear and commonly understood abbreviations.

JavaScript and TypeScript Naming Conventions

    Variables and Constants:
        Use camelCase for variables and function names.
        Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
    Boolean Variables: Prefix with is, should, has, can, did, or will.
    Functions: Use camelCase and name functions to describe their action or return value.
    Classes and Interfaces: Use PascalCase.
    Enums: Use PascalCase for names and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for values.
    File Names: Use kebab-case.
    TypeScript Specific: Optionally prefix types and interfaces with T or I.

Coding Standards and Best Practices

    Single Responsibility Principle: Each function, class, or module should have a single responsibility.
    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication by abstracting repeated logic.
    KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Keep code simple and avoid overengineering.
    YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Only add functionality when necessary.
    Avoid Magic Numbers: Use constants for hard-coded numbers or strings.
    Use Meaningful Commit Messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
    Testing: Write tests with descriptive names.

Additional Best Practices for General Projects

    Version Control: Use a branching strategy like GitFlow or GitHub Flow.
    Code Reviews: Conduct code reviews for quality and knowledge sharing.
    CI/CD: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
    Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation.
    Code Formatting: Use a formatter like Prettier.
